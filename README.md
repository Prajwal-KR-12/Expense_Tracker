# AI-Powered Multi-Agent Financial Management System

## 1. Overview
This project is an AI-powered, multi-agent web application that manages, analyzes, and optimizes user financial data. Each agent operates autonomously to perform specific functions like expense tracking, budgeting, data analysis, and user interaction. The system improves financial decision-making through intelligent collaboration among agents.

## 2. Objective
To upgrade the traditional single-agent expense tracker into a distributed Multi-Agent System that provides automation, intelligent insights, and modular scalability.

## 3. System Architecture
The system consists of several autonomous agents communicating through REST APIs or message queues:

| Agent             | Function                                                  |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| User-Agent        | Manages user login, registration, and profile interactions. |
| Expense-Agent     | Handles expense input, categorization, and validation.    |
| Analytics-Agent   | Generates statistical reports and spending insights.      |
| Budget-Agent      | Suggests saving strategies and spending limits.           |
| Notification-Agent| Sends reminders and alerts via email/SMS.                 |
| Data-Agent        | Performs all database CRUD operations and ensures data integrity. |

## 4. Workflow
1. User interacts through the User-Agent (frontend).
2. Expense-Agent records data and communicates with Data-Agent.
3. Analytics-Agent analyzes stored data to find spending trends.
4. Budget-Agent processes analytics to suggest savings or budgets.
5. Notification-Agent informs the user of financial alerts or recommendations.

## 5. Key Features
- Multi-agent modular architecture.
- Intelligent expense classification and predictions.
- Real-time notifications and analytics dashboard.
- Scalable microservice-based design for distributed operation.
- Secure user authentication and encrypted data management.

## 6. Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js / Next.js
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express) / Python (Flask or FastAPI)
- **Database:** MongoDB / PostgreSQL
- **Communication:** REST API / WebSocket / MQTT
- **AI & Analytics:** TensorFlow.js / Scikit-learn
- **Notifications:** Twilio / Nodemailer

## 7. Expected Outcome
A smart, autonomous web-based expense tracker capable of analyzing, predicting, and advising users on financial habits through inter-agent collaboration.
